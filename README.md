# React + Vite Recruiter Website
Welcome to my React + Vite project, designed for seamless development with modern tooling and rapid feedback cycles. It is a clone of a recruiter website where you can view, update, create and delete job listings all using a mock backend. 

## Key Features

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
